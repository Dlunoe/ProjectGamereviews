## Description
Metacritic has critics, Steam has Curators, but game reviewers are weighted differently. The average gamer has less impact in the review cycle than the big brand media companies. This was important when legacy media was the best way to find out if a game would be a good purchase, but legacy media has a much smaller impact now in the gaming industry. Steam reviews (without curators) are a good direction to take, putting all user reviews into the same collection. I want to bring the importance of reviews back to the people who are going to be spending money to play these games, not the people getting paid to write about them.

## Language Information
This app will use Ruby on Rails for the backend, to generate a database and the CRUD routes associated with it. We will then use React on the front-end to hold the different components that make up the website, and gives us access to reactstrap which is used for building Modals and adding styling.

## Future Versions
-Create a single landing page for each title that houses all reviews, vs housing each review individually.
-Add a ratings system & averages
-->This is following routes of common review pages such as Metacritic, or the Steam store page for a product. If this is implemented, the plan is to keep all reviews averaged together (such as Steam) versus giving a critic section that is weighted differently.

## User Stories
“As a gamer, I want a review site that doesn’t weight critics or journalists more than the average user, so I can see what other gamers think.”

“Being an avid consumer in the videogame market, I want to know the reviews I’m seeing are not part of corporate entities, but other people like me, just enjoying a hobby.”
