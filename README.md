# ProjectGameReviews

## Description
The purpose behind this app is to create a basic website for users to come and leave game reviews. 
Using Rails to build and connect the server, React will be the client front-end language to display information on the page, as well as forms and other CRUD methods being present.

---

## Language Information
This app will use Ruby on Rails for the backend, to generate a database and the CRUD routes associated with it. We will then use React on the front-end to hold the different components that make up the website, and gives us access to reactstrap which is used for building Modals and adding styling.

## Wirefames
Updating soon

## Future Versions
-Create a single landing page for each title that houses all reviews, vs housing each review individually.
-Add a ratings system & averages
-->This is following routes of common review pages such as Metacritic, or the Steam store page for a product. If this is implemented, the plan is to keep all reviews averaged together (such as Steam) versus giving a critic section that is weighted differently.
